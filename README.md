# toDoApplication

BASE MODE
Here are the specific components for the challenge:

[ x ] (Using AngularJS) allow a user to create a task.
[x] The task should be stored inside of a database (MongoDB)
[x] able to delete task
[x] Whether or not a task is complete should be in the database
[x] toggle 'complete' status
[x] visual representation when a task is complete 
[x] as well as the complete option 'checked off'. Each of these are accomplished in CSS, but will need to hook into logic to know whether or not the task is complete. ng-class will come in handy!)

[x] some angular styling if not that, some other styling
