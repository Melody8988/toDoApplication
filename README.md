# toDoApplication

BASE MODE
Here are the specific components for the challenge:

[ ] (Using AngularJS) allow a user to create a task.
[ ] The task should be stored inside of a database (MongoDB)
[ ] option to 'Complete' 
[ ] option to 'Delete'
 visual representation when a task is complete (background of the task container could change from gray to green) as well as the complete option 'checked off'. Each of these are accomplished in CSS, but will need to hook into logic to know whether or not the task is complete. ng-class will come in handy!)
Whether or not a task is complete should also be stored in the database.
Deleting a task should remove it both from the Front End as well as the Database.
Make sure that you also show us your best styling chops.

We would recommend you spend some time thinking about how to approach this problem. Think through all the logic that will be needed prior to writing any code. Think through your Schema for Mongoose and how you will structure your data. Take your time, relax, remember that impostor syndrome is real, and that you are capable of knocking this out of the park!
